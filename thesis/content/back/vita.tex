\chapter{Vita}
Sean Anderson was born in San Francisco, California in 1984. Born to restless parents, he spent a good part of his youth traveling between the United States, Mexico, and Guatemala, where his mother is from. Since then, Mexico has never been far from his heart.

He entered the University of Alabama in Hunstville in 2002, under the tutelage of Dr. Don Gregory. In 2006 he graduated magna cum laude with a degree in physics and a minor in mathematics. That same year marked the beginning of a 3 and a half year break to pursue various artistic interests.

He spent most of 2007 dancing tango and photographing Buenos Aires, Argentina. 2008 marked the return to Mexico, where he helped start the family business until 2009.

In 2010 he began his masters degree in optical science at the Centro de Investigaciones en \'Optica in Le\'on, Mexico with Dr. Ram\'on Carriles as his advisor. This thesis marks the culmination of that work and was completed on January 16, 2012.

He is currently continuing on to pursue his Ph.D. in theoretical surface optics with an emphasis in scientific computing with the guidance of Dr. Bernardo Mendoza. His primary interests are the development and usage of free and open source software, GNU/Linux, and parallel computing applied towards solving various scientific problems.
