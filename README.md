You can also obtain these files from my [personal website](http://www.roguephysicist.org/academics.html) in a compressed archive. It is comprised of three separate parts:

1. The data sets recorded during the experiment,
2. the LaTeX source files for my thesis defense presentation, and
3. the LaTeX source files for the thesis document.

The data directory contains the data sets obtained during the course of the experiment. The raw data sets are included (sorted by date) in addition to the selected data sets used in the thesis. These can be plotted using gnuplot or any other data manipulation program to obtain figures similar to those presented.

The presentation directory contains the Beamer presentation file along with all the images used. Several images are omitted because I do not have permission to redistribute them. You can see these images in the final presentation that can be downloaded from the URL mentioned above. Please do not redistribute or copy them.

The thesis directory contains all the LaTeX files needed to compile the thesis from scratch. You can compile the thesis.tex file manually or with the included make-thesis.sh script. For more on how it is structured, please refer to the documentation on my thesis template found at the same URL as above. 

Please use these files to help further your own scientific and academic endeavors.
